# Airsoft_Implementation
This project is a similar design of the game "Keep talking and nobody explodes" but implemented on a raspberry pi and to be used for airsoft battles/events. The game works as follows. 
Your raspberry pi should be set up with an LCD touch screen, or small keyboard and mouse. Before the start of the airsoft match, place the "bomb" ie the raspberry pi in any location on the map. The opposing team will need to find, and go through several tests to disarm the fake "bomb" before the timer runs out. 

How to use:
--Download the folder in this repository and place it anywhere on your computer

--Open each version file and edit the portions of code where they display the images. Change the path to whatever path you are using for where you placed the images from the previous step

--Next, run the Menu.py file. This will prompt you to choose a version. Note that the timer will start the moment the version is selected, so you should save this step for when the game starts. Keep the version you are using hidden from the opposing team, they will need to work with the clues they have in order to disarm the pi.
